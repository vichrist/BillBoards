## Description
A user can log in and create a budget easily. It has many categories and sub categories for you to make the budget making process a breeze. For every category it has at a glance your budget total, expenses total, and suggeted percentages and amounts based on your total income. 
- Upon entering your first income, a suggested budget is created for you instantly. Those values will change with your income if you add or subtract from it or add multiple income steams.
- You can easily add budget or expense items to each category and everything is totaled up live.
- You can click on and modify your entries and just press enter to lock in your changes.
- You can enter equations to be evaluated for the amount. (ie. 300/12 would save as $25.00)
- Daily, weekly, and bi-weekly income are calculated to a monthly amount for the total income
- Every category is packed with suggestions of items to include there in a dropdown menu when you click to enter the name of a new entry. 
- You can easily see how close your budget is to the income and how close your expenses are to the budget total.
- Expenses are color coded to let you know at a quick glance if you are over or under the budget.
